# EDA with Healthcare datasets
# 🩺 Healthcare Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This beginner's project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset containing information about patients, such as age, gender, blood type, medical condition, and admission details.


# Development Environment

- This project was developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the primary code editor.
- Data exploration and visualization were demonstrated in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- *Name*: Patient's name (not used for analysis)
- *Age*: Patient's age
- *Gender*: Male/Female
- *Blood Type*: ABO blood classification
- *Condition*: Medical diagnosis or condition
- *Room Number*: Hospital room assigned
- *Admission Type*: Emergency, elective, etc.

> The primary goal is to extract insights and visualize trends that could assist in medical and administrative decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the data
- Analyze the distribution of numerical and categorical features
- Identify patterns based on age, gender, and condition
- Visualize relationships and trends

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib 📈
- Seaborn 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- ✔️ Age distribution and patient demographics
- ✔️ Gender-wise breakdown of medical conditions
- ✔️ Admission type analysis
- ✔️ Blood type frequency
- ✔️ Room and condition mapping

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

- Age histogram with KDE
- Count plots for gender and conditions
- Bar charts for admission types
- Pie chart of blood type distribution

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

- Handled missing values
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Checked columns to appropriate data types
- Removed irrelevant or duplicate records
